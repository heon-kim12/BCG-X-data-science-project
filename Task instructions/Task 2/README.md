# Your AD is giving you more responsibility!
Well done for your initial understanding of the case with PowerCo. After reviewing your project plan, the AD would like you lead on the Data Science deliverables for the rest of the project.

The AD would like you to investigate whether price sensitivity is the most influential factor for a customer churning, and if not, to what extent does price sensitivity influence churn.

Before we begin on this task, what exactly is price sensitivity?

# What is price sensitivity?
Price sensitivity is the degree to which demand changes when the cost of a product or service changes.

In the context of PowerCo, the “demand” refers to the demand for energy consumption.

Price sensitivity is commonly measured using the price elasticity of demand, which states that some consumers won't pay more if a lower-priced option is available.


# What is price elasticity of demand?

Price elasticity of demand is a measurement of the change in consumption of a product in relation to a change in its price

Complete the quick knowledge check and move onto your exploratory data analysis.

# Exploratory data analysis
The client has sent over 2 datasets and it your responsibility to perform some exploratory data analysis.

# What is exploratory data analysis?

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a technique used by a Data Scientist to gain a holistic understanding of the data that they are working with.

It is mainly based around using statistical techniques (such as descriptive statistics) and visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of the statistical properties that the data holds.

# Let’s get familiar with the data
As a Data Scientist at BCG, there will be occasions when you need to analyse data or investigate an issue and you are not provided strict instructions or guidance. You may be thinking, where do I start?

It is a highly valuable skill to begin to learn how to investigate a problem independently. A great way to learn this skill is to build a framework for analysis that works for you.

In this step, you'll need to analyse client data sets using Python and upload your work as a Jupyter notebook. We'll show you an example answer on the next step, but we encourage you to give it a go first!


# The client has sent over 3 data sets (shown below):

Historical customer data: Customer data such as usage, sign up date, forecasted usage etc
Historical pricing data: variable and fixed pricing data etc
Churn indicator: whether each customer has churned or not

# You need to analyze the following using Python:

The data types of each column
Descriptive statistics of the dataset
Distributions of columns
